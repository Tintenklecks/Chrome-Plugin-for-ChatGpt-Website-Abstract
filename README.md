# Chrome-Plugin-for-ChatGpt-Website-Abstract-
This is my first Chrome plugin. It does a simple but very useful job. When you use it on an article, it queries the OpenAI API and presents you a 5 bullet list of itÂ´s content with important words highlighted. You have to use your own API key, that you can create at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
